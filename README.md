# Nike Sales Data Analysis & Visualization (Excel)

I'm excited to share my latest **Excel-based Sales Analytics Dashboard**, built to analyze and visualize Nike's retail and online performance across multiple regions, channels, and product categories.

This project demonstrates how Excel can be used as a powerful BI tool by combining **Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Dashboard Design** to deliver meaningful business insights.
